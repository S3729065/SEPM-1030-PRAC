Running NPM Packages:
To run the application with NPM in the browser using `//localhost:8080`
	run `live-server` in the root directory which is: "/web"

If you don't have `node.js` installed, take a minute to install it [https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm]. You can check whether or not **node.js** is already installed by using the `node -v` command in your terminal â€” if it responds with a version number, you're good to go! **node.js** should also come with **npm**, which is short for _Node Package Manager_

The `package.json` should have the necessary packages needed, saved for application runtime through `npm i --save ...`
